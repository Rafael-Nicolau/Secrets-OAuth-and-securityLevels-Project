This project manages all security levels, from a simple lvl 1 single DB with user and password to a high lvl 6 delegation with OAuth and google login.

Since this projects uses different layers of security for comparison it's not suitable for production, but bits of it can be used to make a very robust security layer.

It mainly uses: Passport.JS, Mongoose, md5, bcrypt and a few more dependecies.
